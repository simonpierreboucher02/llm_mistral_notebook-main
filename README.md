This repository provides Jupyter notebooks to interact with Mistral Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks including chatbot development, retrieval-augmented generation, and text generation. These notebooks are designed to help users leverage Mistral models in a range of applications, from conversational AI to content generation.

## Repository Structure

- **[MISTRAL-CHATBOT.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_mistral_notebook/blob/main/MISTRAL-CHATBOT.ipynb)**: A notebook for setting up a Mistral-powered chatbot, demonstrating dialogue handling and response generation.
- **[MISTRAL-RAG.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_mistral_notebook/blob/main/MISTRAL-RAG.ipynb)**: Focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Mistral model, enabling the retrieval of relevant information before generating responses.
- **[MISTRAL-TEXTGEN.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_mistral_notebook/blob/main/MISTRAL-TEXTGEN.ipynb)**: Demonstrates the text generation capabilities of Mistral models, ideal for creative and informative content generation.
